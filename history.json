In Solidity, when you divide integers, the result is also an integer, and any fractional part is truncated. This can lead to a loss of precision and rounding errors, especially when dealing with small amounts.\n\nTo minimize rounding errors, you can do the following:\n\n1. Use a higher precision for the percentages (e.g., use basis points instead of percent, where 1 basis point = 0.01%). This would require adjusting the divisor from 10000 to 1000000.\n\n2. Perform the multiplication before the division, as you have done in your code. This helps to reduce the rounding error, but it may still occur depending on the input values.\n\n3. Use a library like SafeMath or a newer version of Solidity (0.8.x) that has built-in overflow and underflow protection. This will not prevent rounding errors, but it will help to catch any arithmetic issues that might arise.\n\nKeep in mind that even with these precautions, you may still encounter rounding errors. It is essential to thoroughly test your smart contract to ensure that it behaves as expected in all scenarios."}, {"title": "security auditing 2", "user": "would the following function in solidity cause a rounding error?: function calculateRoyalties(uint amount) private pure returns (uint contractRoyalty, uint artistRoyalty) {         contractRoyalty = ( amount * contractRoyaltyPercentage)/ 10000;         artistRoyalty = ( amount * artistRoyaltyPercentage )/ 10000;     }", "bot": "It's possible for the function to have a rounding error due to integer division.
